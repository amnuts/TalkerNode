Lot's of things to do. Here's a list, so I don't forget all of it:

* Make TalkerNode behave properly with recent versions of node-dirty (the new events like load...)
* adapt TalkerNode to use Nodiverse - https://github.com/marado/Nodiverse/
 - people enter in their last node; if none, they enter in default place (mandatory for TalkerNode)
 - adapt existing commands to be localized (say, emote) and create new ones to maintain functionality (shout...)
 - .dig
 - .destroy
* ranks - 'cause you don't want everyone to have .dig and .destroy, right?
 - .ranks (lists ranks, points out yourse)
 - promote (if you're level ... 2?)
 - demote (if you're level = promote's level)
 - .who shows rank
 - .wizlist shows list of users in n top ranks
 - list of commands to manipulate ranks' list
* user connected time (and show on .who)
* user idle time (and show on .who)
* user total time (save on database)
* user registration date (save on database)
* .examine
* send the ANSI character of noecho and echo to wrap around the password input
  events
* Weak passwords shouldn't be allowed
* .map
* configuration settings in a separate .js
* Localization for all the strings
* Check out code's TODO's
