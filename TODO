Lot's of things to do. Here's one list, so I don't forget all of it:

* .version
* implement version on login screen 
* users database (to have autentication) - use node-dirty, perhaps?
* session takeover (only after having an user database)
* user connected time (and show on .who)
* user idle time (and show on .who)
* user total time (save on database)
* user registration date (save on database)
* .examine
