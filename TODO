Lot's of things to do. Here's one list, so I don't forget all of it:

* .password should be interactive, ask for the old password before changing to
  the new one. Interactive is a must, because we actually allow passphrases...
* send the ANSI character of noecho and echo to wrap around the password input
  events
* session takeover
* user connected time (and show on .who)
* user idle time (and show on .who)
* user total time (save on database)
* user registration date (save on database)
* .examine
