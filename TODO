Lot's of things to do. Here's a list, so I don't forget all of it:

* session takeover
* create space (a new project, "Nodiverse, a 3D universe in Node.js"?):
 - universe is an octree (see https://www.npmjs.org/package/octree )
 - each place can have:
  - name (mandatory)
  - description
  - paths
 - the universe and connections are enough to set up a finit size universe on either coordinate, 
 - it is also enough to define if it wraps around in any of them
 - a function is needed to check universe consistency; if operation changes universe state, raise warning
 - people enter in their last node; if none, they enter in "center"
 - adapt existing commands to be localized (say, emote) and create new ones to maintain functionality (shout...)
 - .dig
 - .destroy
* ranks - 'cause you don't want everyone to have .dig and .destroy, right?
* user connected time (and show on .who)
* user idle time (and show on .who)
* user total time (save on database)
* user registration date (save on database)
* .examine
* send the ANSI character of noecho and echo to wrap around the password input
  events
* Weak passwords shouldn't be allowed
* .map
* configuration settings in a separate .js
* Localization for all the strings
