Lot's of things to do. Here's a list, so I don't forget all of it:

* create space (a new project, "Nodiverse, a 3D universe in Node.js"):
 - v1: 
  - universe consists of places and (non-mandatory) initial parameters
  - places are defined by (coords, exits)
   - coords: x, y, z
   - exits: bitmask (NW & N & NE & W & E & SW & S & SE)
  - places can have other non-mandatory fields (name, description, ...)
  - non-mandatory initial parameters: 
   - geometry (plane, sphere, ...)
   - default place
  - methods
   - new universe; edit universe (non-mandatory initial parameters)
   - create place; destroy place; edit place
   - ascii map
 - v2:
  - universe is an octree (see https://www.npmjs.org/package/octree )
* adapt TalkerNode to use Nodiverse
 - people enter in their last node; if none, they enter in default place (mandatory for TalkerNode)
 - adapt existing commands to be localized (say, emote) and create new ones to maintain functionality (shout...)
 - .dig
 - .destroy
* ranks - 'cause you don't want everyone to have .dig and .destroy, right?
* user connected time (and show on .who)
* user idle time (and show on .who)
* user total time (save on database)
* user registration date (save on database)
* .examine
* send the ANSI character of noecho and echo to wrap around the password input
  events
* Weak passwords shouldn't be allowed
* .map
* configuration settings in a separate .js
* Localization for all the strings
