Lot's of things to do. Here's one list, so I don't forget all of it:

* .password should be interactive, ask for the old password before changing to
  the new one. Interactive is a must, because we actually allow passphrases...
* send the ANSI character of noecho and echo to wrap around the password input
  events
* session takeover
* configuration settings in a separate .js
* Localization for all the strings
* user connected time (and show on .who)
* user idle time (and show on .who)
* user total time (save on database)
* user registration date (save on database)
* .examine
* create space (x,y,z):
 - z size: 20; x size: 200000; y size: 200000
 - wraparound: x; y
 - commands all use relative coordinates, to a "center" command-defined
 - people enter in their last coords, if none, they enter in "center"
 - adapt existing commands to be localized (say, emote) and create new ones to maintain functionality (shout...)
 - .dig
 - .destroy
* ranks - 'cause you don't want everyone to have .dig and .destroy, right?
