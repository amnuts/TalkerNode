==========

TalkerNode is a Talker base, written in Node.js .

The original source code was written by sam, from the talker Hades: telnet hades-talker.org 6660

This is a fork from that code, as it was at 11/11/2013.

The latest version of the fork can allways be found at

millions can I get a pint please?"

*Dependencies:*

* TalkerNode is written in Node.js, so you'll obviously need it. 
* TalkerNode depends on node-dirty. You can install it from your regular
  distribution (eg: aptitude install node-dirty), npm (npm install dirty),
  or directly grabbing the code: https://github.com/felixge/node-dirty .
  Unfortunately, the code isn't quite compliant with the newest versions of
  node-dirty, and I can't really tell which was the latest known good version.
  I know it was < 0.9.6. Work to make TalkerNode behave properly with recent
  node-dirty versions is on its way.
